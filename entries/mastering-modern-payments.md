Thousands of small businesses are using <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> to process recurring or one-time payments for their <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> SaaS offerings. Most of them, probably including yours, are using a simple integration copied from a "Stripe in 10 minutes" tutorial, but what these tutorials don't cover could cost you customer good will and  <strong>thousands of dollars</strong> in lost payments and lost opportunities.

* Expired credit cards
* Lost transactions due to timeouts and bugs
* Lost time digging through Stripe's dashboard or the Rails console to see your quarterly revenue or to find a specific customer's transaction
