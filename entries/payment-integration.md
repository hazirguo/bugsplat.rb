Thousands of small businesses are using <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> to process recurring or one-time payments for their <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> SaaS offerings. Most of them, probably including yours, are using a simple integration copied from a "Stripe in 10 minutes" tutorial, but what these tutorials don't cover could cost you customer good will and  <strong>thousands of dollars</strong> in lost payments and lost opportunities. 
</p>

* Expired credit cards
* Lost transactions due to timeouts and bugs
* Lost time digging through Stripe's dashboard or the Rails console to see your quarterly revenue or to find a specific customer's transaction

<p class="jumbo">You don't have to suffer through those problems</p>

My new guide <strong><em>Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails</em></strong> will teach you:

* Why a simple, 10 minute integration **isn't enough**
* How to build **maintainable** payment forms that **convert**
* How, where, and why to use Stripe's `stripe.js` and `checkout.js`
* Why you should always structure payments as state machines
* Why and how you should write an admin interface from the start
* How to handle subscription billing
* What *dunning* is and how to use it to **put thousands of dollars in
  your pocket**
* How and why you should process payments using a background worker
