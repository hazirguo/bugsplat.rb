Over the past two years I've written four web applications from scratch using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. Every single one of these applications uses <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> to process recurring or one-time payments. With each new implmentation I've learned new things and realized new mistakes that my previous implementations had.
</p>

I want to share what I've learned, so I've started writing an eBook called <strong><em>Payment Integration: Using Stripe with Rails</em></strong>. In this book you'll learn:

* Why a simple, 10 minute integration **isn't enough**
* How to build **maintainable** payment forms that convert
* How, where, and why to use Stripe's `stripe.js` and `checkout.js`
* Why you should always structure payments as state machines
* Why and how you should write an admin interface from the start
* How to handle subscription billing
* What "dunning" is and how to use it to **put thousands of dollars in
  your pocket**
* How and why you should process payments using a background worker
* You'll also get exclusive access to a sample Rails application that
  implements every single one of these best practices.
