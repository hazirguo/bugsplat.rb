  per month across more than 60,000 free-to-play single- and
  multiplayer games.

  and Node.JS background jobs to front-end HTML, Javascript and CSS.

#### Platform Developer, 2011 - 2012 ###

[Emma](http://www.myemma.com), Portland, OR

* Ported the audience management system of Emma, including mailing list
  management, audience searches, administration, and sending mail
  into a REST/JSON service in Python, running on PostgreSQL and Redis.

* Built a search engine that consumes a JSON search description,
  builds an equivalent SQL query, and executes the query on a sharded
  PostgreSQL database system. This is used for filtering all requests
  that come into the audience REST service.

* Worked with and extended a large Django application that forms the
  front-end of Emma's email marketing service.

#### Software Developer, 2007 - 2011 ###

[Rentrak Corporation](http://www.rentrak.com), Portland, OR

* Designed, developed, and deployed two different demographics systems
  for linear television that have set the direction of all future demographics
  systems at Rentrak. These systems overlay postal- and household-level
  segmentation on top of hundreds of billions of television view transactions.

* Developed a SQL-like language that compiles to C++ using Perl and
  [Parse::RecDescent](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-RecDescent) to
  enable internal users to query the view repository.

* Designed and deployed a system for distributed job processing using
  [Gearman](http://gearman.org) which will form the core for all new
  distributed or delayed job processing company-wide.

* Designed a new product from scratch with another developer on a three
  month contract, focusing on the backend data processing. Built a DSL-like
  system within Perl for succinct summary table definition which allows
  developers to create new summary tables quickly and with very low maintenance
  overhead.
  
* Wrote one-time and repeatable data extraction and analysis programs
  for the CIO and the research department to better understand hundreds of billions 
  of television view transactions. 

* Worked with another developer and the system administration team to
  convert the entire company from subversion to git. Internal repos are
  hosted using [gitolite](http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite).
  
* Built a video player using Adobe ActionScript and Flex that shows
  DVR-style recordings with viewership data overlays.

* Implemented an experimental perl-based framework on top of
  [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and HDFS that was used to test some
  performance hypotheses.

#### Software Development Intern, 2006

Quad Graphics and UWW Management and Computer Systems

* Enhanced Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord support for Sybase
* Extended ActiveRecord's ability to generate model objects from
  arbitrary database tables.
* Used these new capabilities to enable repeatable unit testing
  of database-driven .Net applications on developers' desktops by
  pulling only the needed sets of test data from a central database.

#### Research Assistant, Fall 2005 - Spring 2006

Aurora Health Care and UWW Management Computer Systems

* Implemented a data aggregation system among several dissimilar data silos
  using JSP, servlets, Lucene, jUnit, ant, and MS SQL Server. Silos did not share 
  primary keys and contained similar but not identical profile information, so the 
  system guided a user through a three step selection and matching process.
